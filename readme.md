# My first FTP server
## role of the practice
Initiated from the assignment required by Computer Network practice course
as a demo for showing my comprehension on ftp service.
based on socket and Qt

## my role in the project

contribute as the UI designer, one of the ftp implementation co-worker.

## my comprehension on Qt

Qt is of a kind of completed but inconvenient GUI coding IDE based on xml and cpp. I do not really like it, but i have to admit that it is too late for me to meet this kit, because it is really a good choice for former coder in high school and universities. I cannot use this as tkinter, but it is not difficult for me to adapt myself to use this.

FPT server is one of the basic network service, however, not so useful in daily life nowadays. Nevertheless, it is still a efficient way for file co-management and use in a team. Implementing a ftp work is a good experience for me to have a thorough overlook upon network transmitting from the very bottom as primary as socket.
